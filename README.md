# Accredit-Task - Chris Frear

Unfortunately I was quite short on time for this task, and so the error handling is quite basic and unit tests are missing. 
Nor does the application look particularly pretty, but it does the job and is robust.

To run the application, open the "Accredit-Task" folder and open Accredit-Task.sln in Visual Studio.
Then with the HomeController.cs class open, run the application in your browser. (If you have some other class open, like Results.cshtml the app give a 404 error.)
